      <p>
        I've always been obsessed with building things from a young age. It
        started with legos and then as soon as I could afford to I moved on to
        computer hardware. The process of finding all of the compatible parts
        and trying to squeeze things into a budget is very exciting to me. After
        that I found out about programming and it was very interesting to me so
        I decied to check it out. I wrote my very first lines of code in high
        school and from there I was hooked. I got the same thrill as I did when
        building computer but instead of hardware it was software and it did not
        cost a single penny! I started to experiment with different languages
        such as C++ and Java by building small programs and making bots for a
        game called runescape. I still did some programming in my free time once
        I was in college as I still very much enjoyed it. In April of 2018 I
        decided to pursue web development as an actual career and have been
        self-teaching ever since. I've learned a lot about the web and software
        development in general and continue to push myself to learn more and
        become better!
