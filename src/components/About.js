        <p class="about__text">Hi, Iâ€™m Dane. A frontend developer from Toronto, ON. I enjoy building fast and
            responsive web applications using the latest web technologies. My language of choice is JavaScript but I
            like to dabble in other languages such as Python and Golang. Other than software development some of my
        other interests include skateboarding, video games, music and food!</p>
